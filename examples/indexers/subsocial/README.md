# Subsocial

Hydra Indexers for the [Subsocial](https://subsocial.network/) network

The type definition file `typedefs.json` was generated from typescript definitions in the library `@subsocial/types@0.4.35-beta.2` (see also apps-config [routine](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/blob/04d931c50d129706d8a85ffb21c014663d9d285a/packages/apps-config/src/api/util.ts#L4) ).

Additionally, `Address` types were overriden to comply with transaction format. More info can be found [here](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/FAQ/#i-cannot-send-transactions-sending-yields-decoding-failures)
